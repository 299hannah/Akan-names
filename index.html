                        <p>The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of the week they were
                            born
                            and the order in which they were born. These "day names" have further meanings concerning
                            the
                            soul and character of the person. Middle names have considerably more variety and can refer
                            to
                            their birth order, twin status, or an ancestor's middle name.

                            This naming tradition is shared throughout West Africa and the African diaspora. During the
                            18thâ€“19th centuries, enslaved people in the Caribbean from the region that is modern-day
                            Ghana
                            were referred to as Coromantees. Many of the leaders of enslaved people's rebellions had
                            "day
                            names" including Cuffy, Cuffee or Kofi, Cudjoe or Kojo, Quao or Quaw, and Quamina or
                            Kwame/Kwamina.

                            Most Ghanaians have at least one name from this system, even if they also have an English or
                            Christian name. </p>
